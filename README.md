# DATA6550_Group5
Hi John, Miracle, Abby and Stiven: this is the class code repo for DATA6550 Group5

here is some quick feedback in case you haven't used Github previously. 

# Project Name: DATA6550_Group5

This repository is organized with individual folders for each team member to manage their contributions.

## Workflow

1. **Create a Branch:** Before starting any work, create a new branch named after your feature or task (e.g., `feature/new-feature`, `bugfix/issue-123`).  `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
2. **Work in Your Folder:**  Place all your project files within your designated folder (e.g., `team_member_1/`).
3. **Commit Changes:**  Commit your changes regularly with descriptive messages. `git add .`, `git commit -m "Implemented new feature"`
4. **Push Your Branch:** Push your branch to the remote repository. `git push origin feature/new-feature`
5. **Create a Pull Request:** Once you've finished your work, create a pull request to merge your branch into the `main` branch.
6. **Code Review:** Your code will be reviewed by other team members.
     NOTE: i think this has to be done by someone so we can 'merge' the files to accept the changes, but we can talk about that more as we get commits.....
8. **Merge:** After approval, your pull request will be merged into `main`.
